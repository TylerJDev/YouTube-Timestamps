# YouTube Timestamps

YouTube Timestamps is a plugin to track timestamps on any video which contains them.

On YouTube, a content creator can add timestamps to either the description, or within the comments - which any user is free and able to do if the comment section permits. This plugin will grab those timestamps and display them in an easy to read format. The current timestamp selected will be highlighted, and marked as a heading under the title of the video.

## Installing

Soon to be released on the Google Chrome Web Store.

You can install this app by downloading/cloning this repository,
Unzip the folder, and load unpacked on Chrome.

## Running the tests
